# UI-elements-workspace

This folder is a test space for some reusable UI elements for use in part 2. Once an element is done it will get added to global-styles or something.

Elements requested by make-it-all:

- Search bar
- Search-dropdown combo for projects and employees (like outlook)
- Right facing tooltips for the sidebar menu items. It may be easier to just make dynamically facing tooltips.

Other elements we will end up needing:

- Current page title element
- Textarea input with formatting buttons (B, I, bullets etc.) for wiki, editing task descriptions (?)
- Potential context menu for use throughout UI
- Drop down window for the notifications panel (see discord activity pane).
