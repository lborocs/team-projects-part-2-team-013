# UI-elements-workspace

This folder is a test space for some reusable UI elements for use in part 2. Once an element is done it will get added to global-styles or something.

Elements requested by make-it-all:

- (done) Search bar
- (done) Search-dropdown combo for projects and employees (like outlook)
- (done) Right facing tooltips for the sidebar menu items. It may be easier to just make dynamically facing tooltips.

Other elements we will end up needing:

- Current page title element
- (done - quill) Textarea input with formatting buttons (B, I, bullets etc.) for wiki, editing task descriptions (?)
- Potential context menu for use throughout UI
- (done) Drop down window for the notifications panel.


**the js files are there to show the bare minimum needed for the element to function. Make sure you've got event listeners on all elements you want to interact with**
