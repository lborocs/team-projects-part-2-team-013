# Infrastructure overview
![Network diagram detailing the server side setup](https://cdn.013.team/development/Screenshot-2023-11-30-010257.png)

There are also 2 other sites used as CDNS:
- cdn.013.team - used for hosting static web asssets (images, videos, icons etc)
- usercontent.013.team - used for hosting usercontent such as avatars etc.

# Infrastructure configuration
The api requires for each node to be able to include a php file containing secrets and config info using the following format:
```php
<?php
// infrastrucure
const MYSQL_DATABASE = "team013";
const MYSQL_USERNAME = "team013";
const MYSQL_PASSWORD = "database password";
const MYSQL_SERVER = "localhost";
const SESSION_VALIDATION_BASE = "http://localhost:4231/";

// encryption
const SESSION_HMAC_ALGO = "sha3-256";
const SESSION_ENCRYPTION_ALGO = "aes-256-cbc";

// both 256 bit keys
const SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY_HEX = "session encryption key";
const SESSION_HMAC_KEY_HEX = "session signing key";

// gcp
const GCP_CREDENTIALS_OBJECT = Array(); // creds.json array form

const GOOGLE_ASSET_BUCKET_NAME = "usercontent.013.team"; // storage bucket name
?>
```


# Run on local machine

## with production api

1. Install [PHP VS16 x64 Non Thread Safe](https://windows.php.net/download/)
2. Extract to `C:\php`
3. (Optional) Install the [PHP Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brapifra.phpserver) extension for VS Code
   1. (If using the extension) Change the php server location to serve from `web/` OR open the `web/` folder directly in vscode
   2. In the extension settings give the directory of your php folder and php.ini to PHP Server
   3. Start the php server in the `web` folder

        *Make sure there is a trailing slash in URLs because php server wont load styles or scripts if there isnt.*

        *URLs should look like this:* `localhost:3000/dashboard/` `localhost:3000/`

4. (If not) The repo comes with some run and debug configurations, select `php launch web server`

    *navigate to localhost:8000*

The site should now function like normal on your local machine.

## setting up local api
1. change the php include path to include the api folder include_path = ".;C:\..\githubrepo\api\"
2. enable the openssl, curl, mysqli, mbstring, fileinfo extensions
3. download the GTSRootR1 certificate from the iternet
4. add the `curl.cainfo="path/to/certificate"` entry to the config under the `[curl]` heading
5. install composer
6. install the composer packages: google/cloud-storage in the api folder
7. install mariadb and setup an account to access
8. create the secrets.php
   1. generate 2 encryption keys in a hex representation
   2. insert the database credentials you just created
9. import the database format (dump.sql on the discord or get the latest backup from gcp) using 'mariadb < dump.sql' with the credentials
10. instead of running the web server like above select `RUN DEVELOPMENT API`
11. the api will need a copy of the invalidation service running so make sure you can run (and possibly build) it
12. in global-api.js uncomment the const API_BASE and change it to the address of the php server you just started
