# Run on local machine

1. Install [PHP VS16 x64 Non Thread Safe (direct download)](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.12-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip)
2. Extract to `C:\php`
3. Rename `php.ini-development` to `php.ini`
4. Un-comment these lines by removing the semicolon:
    - `;extension=curl`
    - `;extension=mysql`
    - `;extension=openssl`
5. Install the [PHP Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brapifra.phpserver) extension for VS Code
6. In the extension settings give the directory of your php folder and php.ini to PHP Server
7. Run `invalidation_service.exe`
8. Open any .html file with PHP Server

    *Make sure there is NOT a trailing slash in URLs because php server doesn't handle this well.*

    *URLs should look like this:* `localhost:3000/web/index.html`

The site should now function like normal on your local machine.
